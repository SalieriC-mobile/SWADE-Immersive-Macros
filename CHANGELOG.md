## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - Unreleased  

## [0.8.0] - 2021-07-01
**Possibly** compatible with Foundry 0.8.x but I can't say for sure.  
### You need to update these macros:  
- (Un-)Stun  
- Ammo Management (enhanced)  
- SWIM: Ammo Management  
### Added  
- Ammo Management: Now supports Weapons that do not require a reload action (i.e. bows).  
- Ammo Management: Now offers a way to only reload a single bullet instead of reloading the entire weapon. This is especially useful for revolvers and such.  
- Ammo Management: Charge Packs can now change the ammo type but old Charge Packs are only refilled if the weapons current shots are equal the maximum shots as there is no way to track remaining charges on a Charge Pack.  
- Ammo Management (BR2 integration only): Now supports weapons which *may* be thrown but don't need to. It filters for a set of Skills and only applies ammo usage if such skills are found. See the [documentation on Ammo Management](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/documentation/Ammo%20Management%20Setup.md) for further details.  
- BR2 integration for ammo management now gets the correct amount of shots from BR2 (requires [Better Rolls 2 (BR2)](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/betterrolls-swade2) **greater** than version 2.36.).  

## [0.7.0] - 2021-05-29  
### You need to update these macros:  
- All of them.  
### Fixed  
- All Macros that became broken due to the Foundry Version 0.7.10
- Fixed a bug in the Unshake (SWADE) macro that removed Shaken on a Failure.  
### Added  
- Reload and Reload (enhanced) macro.  
- BR2 integration for Shooting action.  
- Scale calculator macro, thanks @brunocalado.  
- Deviation macro, thanks @brunocalado.  
- (Un-)Stun now also applies Elan bonus on rerolls if the selected token has that edge.  
## VERY IMPORTANT:  
Most of these macros cannot be used as they are, reading the [ReadMe](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/README.md) is **mandatory**!  
If you want to use the new Ammo Managemenet, make sure to read the [Documentation on Ammo Management](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/documentation/Ammo%20Management%20Setup.md) as well!  
I can't stress enough how important it is to do so. *Do not blame me, if something goes sideways if you haven't read and followed the steps outlined there!*
